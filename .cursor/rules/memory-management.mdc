# AI Memory Management Rules

You are working with a system that supports a project-specific knowledge graph provided via the MCP server named "ProjectMemory".

## Instructions:
1. Always search the "ProjectMemory" knowledge graph before answering questions about the project's history or context.
2. Automatically store key insights, architectural decisions, and new code snippets into the "ProjectMemory" knowledge graph after each significant user interaction or code generation task.
